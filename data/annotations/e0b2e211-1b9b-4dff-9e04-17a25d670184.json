Saraffian is referring to two visits in early April 1945. On April 6,1945 another Red Cross delegation visited Theresienstadt, most likely in preparation for the release of Danish prisoners on April 15, 1945, which was facilitated by the Swedish Red Cross. The delegation’s report cynically characterized Theresienstadt as “a small Jewish state.” Cf. Benz, "
