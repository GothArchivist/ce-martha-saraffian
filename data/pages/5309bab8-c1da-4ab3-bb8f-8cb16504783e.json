Her observant Jewish family belonged to the upper-middle class – her father Friedrich Kummermann was a successful textile merchant. Martha was well educated, and an entrepreneur herself. In 1931 she married Hrand Saraffian, an Armenian Christian refugee from Constantinople, with whom she had two daughters, Noemi and Hanna. Despite her civil marriage to a Protestant, Martha Saraffian remained a member of the Jewish community and their first daughter, Noemi, was raised as Jewish. After the annexation the Saraffian family was discriminated against, persecuted for their \"mixed marriage.\"[1] Martha Saraffian was eventually deported to the Ghetto Theresienstadt/Terezín in 1945 and her husband interned in several forced labor camps. While many of Martha’s family members perished in the Holocaust, including her mother who was murdered near Lublin, the couple and their children survived in occupied Czechia. After liberation, they emigrated to Argentina and later, in the 1960s, after Hrand had passed away, to New York City, where Martha lived until December 2006."

First, it is one of the few first-generation testimonies in the Fortunoff Archive of a Jew surviving the Holocaust in a mixed marriage. Indeed, her testimony concerns the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, where conditions for such families were in many respects even worse than in many areas of the Reich proper. Second, she was married to a survivor of the Armenian massacres in Ottoman Turkey, a stateless refugee, who was nonetheless considered \"Aryan\" under the Nuremberg Race Laws. For Hrand Saraffian, the Holocaust was the second major experience of persecution in his life. This intersection of the history of the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust in the lives of one family is certainly unique. Their experiences during the Holocaust are nevertheless representative of the fate of many Czech and Sudeten-German mixed marriages. Martha Saraffian’s testimony revolves primarily around her experience as an \"intermarried\" Jew, the fate of her children, persecuted as Jewish \"Mischlinge,\" of her husband’s slave labor, as well as her own experience as a forced laborer in Prague and later in Theresienstadt ghetto. In the end, hers is also a story of seeking justice."

In this brief introduction, I will first introduce the setting of the testimony, recorded in 1984, and then attempt to reconstruct Saraffian’s family background, which is only briefly mentioned at the beginning of her testimony. I will contextualize her experience of persecution in the larger history of the Holocaust in Bohemia and the Sudetenland and the specific situation of mixed marriages in this region. My focus is on the lesser known aspects of this experience, in particular, the special labor camps that were maintained for both intermarried Jews and their non-Jewish spouses."

By this date she had lived in the United States for 21 years, 5 having lived for about 15 years previously in Argentina, where the family emigrated to after the war. While her command of English was certainly not bad, it lacked the fluency of her native German tongue, and was perhaps her fourth or fifth language. While some parts of the testimony are rich in detail, others lack \"thick description\" and levels of detail. Strikingly, none of the members of her family – neither her husband, her children, 6 nor her parents – are mentioned by name in the testimony. However, when Saraffian did mention names of persons and places or specific events she demonstrated an extraordinary memory, only occasionally confusing places and dates. This accuracy of her testimony has allowed for the reconstruction of some of the \"gaps\" in her narration and the finding of further documents. As stated, her marriage to a non-Jew, an Armenian refugee, and the complicated status of her children – one was a member of the Jewish community, the other was not – were important aspects of her life story, of her experience. These were the aspects she wanted to start her testimony with and to which she continuously returned. However, she was frequently interrupted by the interviewers, who were apparently pushing for a more chronological and \"scenic\" narration."

This was apparently Dwork’s first interview for the Video Archive and Laub’s intended role was most likely to guide and supervise her. At the beginning of the recording, Laub can be heard explaining to Saraffian: \"Bonnie will ask you most of the questions. I'll be mostly silent.\" This, however, did not quite prove to be the case. Laub would eventually ask just as many questions and make as many comments on Saraffian’s narration as Dwork. At times he also served as a translator from German into English."

          "text": "Martha Kummermann grew up in the period of great political, national, and social transformations before, during, and after World War I in the northern border region of what was to become Czechoslovakia.0 When she was born, on September 15, 1907, her birthplace, the town of Vinohrady or Königliche Weinberge, as it was known in German, was still an independent suburb of Prague, by then the capital of the Austrian crown land of Bohemia.1 A year later, her family moved to north-eastern Bohemia, near the Silesian border. This crown land, one part of the historic Czech lands, which had received a certain degree of autonomy after the Austrian-Hungarian compromise of 1867, was the major site of an ongoing national conflict between Austrian Czechs and Austrian Germans.2 The Czechs, who were the majority in Bohemia, had strived for national autonomy or even independence for decades. Most Germans in the region fiercely opposed any such initiative. Bohemia was therefore an epicenter of both German and Czech nationalism and radicalization. It is thus not surprising that in 1903 the German Workers’ Party, an early forerunner of the Austrian and German-Czech National Socialist movement, was founded in the heavily industrialized region. Bohemian Jews were caught in the middle of this national struggle between Czechs and Germans, which also extended to other regions of the monarchy, such as Moravia and even Vienna. In the 18th and 19th centuries the majority of Bohemian Jews had identified as Germans, at least on paper, as the Austro-Hungarian system of nationality was based on self-identification and the self-declared everyday language of its citizens.4 Hence these national identities were always fluid and never cemented. Identifications began to shift towards the Czech side at the turn of the century, especially in the Czech majority areas, and a vocal minority of Bohemian Jews also supported Zionism. However, many citizens of the region, whether Jewish or not, were in the truest sense \"multicultural\" and bilingual, at least to some degree, and shifting identifications were also a matter of political allegiances. According to the 1910 census, 62.66% of the inhabitants of Bohemia spoke Czech (including Slovakian) as their daily common language, whereas 36.45% were German speakers (in Austria-Hungary as a whole 23.36% were German speakers, 19.57% Hungarian speakers and 12.54% spoke Czech and Slovakian, the rest other languages). Jews accounted for only 1.5% of the entire Bohemian population at the time. However, in Prague, Jews accounted for a large part, perhaps even the majority, of the city’s German population."

While the new republic was hailed for its liberal and tolerant policies, neither the national conflict nor antisemitism vanished. In many ways only the roles were reversed between the ethnic groups: now it was the Germans who became the separatists (as well as the Hungarians and Ukrainians in the East). Many Germans, especially in the Bohemian periphery and in Moravia, agitated either for reunification with Austria or, increasingly, for the annexation of the borderlands by Germany. These voices grew continuously louder after 1933. Jewish citizens, even if they identified culturally as Germans, were mostly loyal to the new Czechoslovakian Republic, which was religiously tolerant and curbed antisemitism for the longest time."

The historic city of Trautenau is located at the river Aupe/Úpa, a tributary of the Elbe/Labe, in the south-eastern foothills of the Sudeten/Sudety, a large mountain range between Bohemia and Silesia, today roughly along the border between Czechia and Poland. At the time, Trautenau, just as almost the entire northern border region, was almost exclusively inhabited by Germans.9 In the interwar period, the term \"Sudeten\" – previously only referring to the mountain range – began to take on a new meaning: Sudeten-Germans (Sudetendeutsche) became a quasi-self-designation of the Czechoslovakian Germans, especially those living in the northern and western border lands. German separatists began to refer to these regions, which did not form a political unity until the Nazi annexation in October 1938, as Sudetenland, the land of the Sudeten-Germans. While these areas were not granted any form of autonomy by the Czechoslovakian state, German was still used as an official administrative and educational language. In her testimony, Saraffian refers to this linguistic and political change in meaning: \"And we moved to the Sudeten. At this time, it was Austria. It was not Sudeten.\" Despite the political changes after World War I, Trautenau remained an almost entirely German-speaking town with around 13,000 inhabitants."

The town promised good economic opportunities, as it was well connected by railway to its hinterland, the major urban centers, and to nearby Germany. In 1910, the town’s Jewish population peaked at 478 persons and then slowly declined in the interwar period. The small Jewish community (at any given point less than around four percent of the population) was well integrated into the civic society and social fabric of the town, and played an important role in the linen industry, which was the strongest industrial and commercial sector of Trautenau."

The city had an old Jewish community dating back the 14th century. As in many other peripheral towns, the Jewish population began to decline in the 1890s as the younger generation – including Kummermann himself – moved to larger cities, such as Prague or Vienna, or even emigrated overseas. His father, Emanuel Kummermann, born in the mid-1830s, was a merchant in Humpoletz. When he died in 1906, he and his wife Fanni had at least seven children, all of whom lived in different Bohemian towns. One of Friedrich’s brothers, Robert, was trading in Humpoletz in fashion accessories. Perhaps Emanuel Kummermann had encouraged his children to move to different towns in order to facilitate a merchant network among the family. This social practice was quite common among Bohemian families at the time, especially in the textile trade, for which Bohemia – and also Humpoletz – was well know. Friedrich Kummermann’s later wife, Elvira Louise Steiner, Martha Saraffian’s mother, was born on July 25, 1881 in the very small village of Dlouhá Lhota (in German sometimes called Langlhota), halfway between the towns of Neweklau/Neveklov and Beneschau/Benešova. The village also had a small Jewish population belonging to the larger Neveklov community in the nearby city. During World War II it was mostly destroyed, as the Germans turned the area into an SS-proving ground (training area). In the early 20th century, Friedrich and Elvira Kummermann lived in Königliche Weinberge/Vinohrady near Prague, where both of their daughters were born. Their first child, Gretl, on June 28, 1906 and just a year later, Martha."

Handweberei). Another indicator of the modest wealth of the family is the 1921 census, which reveals that they had a household help living with them. Marie Ende was a Catholic, born in 1895 in a village just outside Trautenau. The house at Reichstraße 5 also contained a second apartment, by then rented out to a single tenant.

Independent Czechoslovakia had adopted, by and large, the Imperial Austrian system of national self-identification based on everyday language. However, for the 1921 census the authorities also introduced the option of \"Jewish\" as a national affiliation.  German and Hungarian nationalists decried this as an attempt to weaken Jewish affiliation with their respective minorities. In 1921, under 15 percent of Bohemian Jews identified as \"national Jews\" – the others as Czechs or Germans. In total, however, about half of the 354,000 Czechoslovakian Jews made this identification; in the East, Carpatho-Ukraine and Slovakia, it was over 90 percent. By the late 1920s the numbers of \"national Jews\" increased in Bohemia, with around 20 percent declaring Jewish nationality, 50 percent Czech and 30 percent German.  According to Jörg Osterloh’s estimate, about 30 percent of Jews in the later Reich District Sudetenland, which included Trautenau, identified as national Jews in the early 1930s and most of the others as Germans and some as Czechs.  The exact numbers for Trautenau were 13.5 percent in 1921 and 19.3 in 1930; the other Jews identified as Germans.  In 1921, the entire Kummermann family declared German nationality and Jewish religion.  This is perhaps not surprising in a then almost exclusively German-speaking town, where even the bilingual Czech-German Czechoslovakian census forms were filled out entirely in German. As Wolf Gruner convincingly argues, in the mid-1930s the situation of German-speaking Jews in Czechoslovakia became increasingly precarious. On the one hand radical antisemitism was rapidly increasing, foremost among the Sudeten-Germans, on the other hand, Czech nationalists labelled them national traitors, siding with the Germans. "

Her husband was born on June 17, 1891 in Constantinople/Istanbul in the Ottoman Empire.  At that time Istanbul had a large Armenian population. Initially discriminated against but now tolerated and considered loyal to the Turkish authorities, in the last quarter of the 19th century a strong movement for Armenian national independence grew throughout the Empire. The Ottoman authorities answered with severe repression and several bloody massacres in many Armenian communities in the 1890s. The years 1894 to 1896 saw a campaign of mass killings, the so-called \"Hamidian massacres,\" with 80,000 to 300,000 Armenians murdered, according to varying estimates, and up to 50,000 children orphaned.  It is very likely that Hrand Saraffian and his siblings were among these orphans and were brought to Europe in a humanitarian effort, perhaps organized by Armenians living in the diaspora. According to a post-war document of the International Tracing Service, Hrand Saraffian left Istanbul in 1897 at the age of six and \"since then he has not acquired any other citizenship.\" 43 His background, his experience of flight and persecution, left a great impression on Martha Kummermann when she met him:"

While we lack further details, one indication that he indeed moved to Vienna as a boy or teenager is an Upper Austrian newspaper report from 1908. The newspaper reported a 16-year old Turkish servant from Constantinople, by the name of \"Rhand Sarafian,\" who was the victim of sexual harassment by a known offender when he stayed overnight in Wels during a journey. The police intervened and the servant continued his journey to Vienna, according to the report.  Perhaps even before the end of the war, Hrand Saraffian moved to Bohemia, and began to trade in Persian carpets. Trading businesses, especially those importing Turkish and Oriental goods, were widespread among the European Armenian diaspora. In a Czech newspaper from April 1924 it is mentioned that, in 1922, Saraffian already traded with Persian carpets in Karlín, which today is part of Prague.  According to his citizen registration card, he moved to Trautenau on December 7, 1929, coming from Rumburg/Rumburk, a town in northwestern Bohemia. Another interesting detail on the registration card is that he apparently had already been married before: in 1922 Hrand Saraffian married an unidentified woman in Hohenelbe/Vrchlabí, just west of Trautenau.  It is unclear if the marriage ended in divorce or if his first wife died."

Martha was especially intrigued by Hrand’s stories of the Armenian persecution, as she mentions in her testimony. In the testimony she draws parallels between the Jewish and the Armenian experience. Her parents, however, strongly discouraged the relationship and sent her to Berlin, where one of Martha’s cousins studied at a rabbinical school. Apparently, they hoped that her cousin would talk her out of the relationship to a non-Jew, but he did not. During this time, Martha’s grandmother, who lived with the family, died, and Martha was blamed for causing her grandmother’s death. According to Martha’s mother, the grandmother had been so deeply disturbed by her granddaughter’s plan of marrying a non-Jew that she fell ill. Her parents’ opposition caused emotional hardship for Martha, which were exacerbated by her father’s poor health and his temporary refusal to speak to her. Nevertheless, Hrand Saraffian and Martha Kummermann eventually married on June 30, 1931 in Trautenau in a civil marriage.  Her decision to go through with the marriage deepened the rift with her parents:"

Nevertheless, he characterizes it as a tightknit community, with many institutions, clubs, and a vibrant social life. Conversions were relatively uncommon in Trautenau. Intermarriage rates, however, were high throughout Czechoslovakia towards the 1930s (around 30 percent of all marriages involving a Jewish spouse). Martha’s parents were apparently deeply unhappy with their daughter’s choice for a life partner. It may have been a small comfort that she did not convert to Christianity, as the Czechoslovakian marriage law allowed for interreligious civil marriages. For Martha Saraffian this rift with her parents was quite painful, as we learn from the testimony. It seems likely that it was not only religion alone that caused the opposition of her parents: Hrand Saraffian’s national status, his citizenship, was extremely unclear, and contemporary citizenship law mandated that Martha Kummermann lost her Czechoslovakian citizenship when she married a foreigner.

From this time the long lingering threat of an annexation of the German-speaking border regions by Nazi Germany – something Sudeten German activists, affiliated with the Nazi Party, had agitated for increasingly from 1933 onwards – became a very real possibility. According to many reports, most Czechoslovakian Jews, including those in the Sudetenland, had seen the rise of Nazism in Germany, especially in the early years, as a purely German affair. They felt safe in Czechoslovakia for the longest time and most made no preparations for emigration. Things began to change slightly in the mid-1930s, when more and more German-Jewish refugees arrived in Czechoslovakia and reports of the Nazi persecution of Jews and political enemies circulated widely. At the same time, domestic antisemitism was also on the rise – both among the Sudeten-Germans and the Czech majority. Nevertheless, until early 1938 the threat posed by Nazism seemed far away. With the annexation of Austria, Czechoslovakia was suddenly encroached upon by Nazi Germany from the north, west, and south – and the situation became more threatening."

In the interwar period Podiebrad developed into an internationally known spa town. As Friedrich Kummermann suffered from various illnesses for a long time he was probably also seeking the comforts of the spas. While he was gone, Hrand Saraffian took care of certain financial affairs for his father-in-law. This further improved their relationship.

Immediately after the agreement, in the first two weeks of October 1938, German troops occupied the Sudetenland, which was carved out of Czechoslovakia very roughly along ethnic lines. Throughout the region, including Trautenau, riots and violent attacks on Czech and Jewish businesses and persons erupted. In Trautenau, according to Wlaschek, it was allegedly SA-men from nearby Silesia who were responsible for most of the violence against the Jewish community. It seems very likely that local supporters of the Sudeten German Party – the regional Nazi affiliate – also partook in the violence.

The occupation of Czechia meant that the Nazis gained control over about 118,000 Jews, 56 among them many who had fled from the Sudetenland just months or weeks earlier. In June 1939, the Germans extended parts of the Nuremberg laws to the Protectorate.  The small number of ethnic Germans were immediately granted German citizenship, whereas Czechs received second-class status as subjects of the Protectorate. While the Protectorate was primarily a propaganda trick of Nazi Germany to curb Czech resistance and secure its control of the region, historians still debate the degree to which the Czech side was able to partake in the regime and the Holocaust. A recent study by Wolf Gruner paints a nuanced picture: while Berlin ultimately had the final say, Czech authorities advanced their own initiatives and agendas, as did the regional Nazi apparatus and power structures.  This is particularly true for the implementation of the Holocaust in this region. While older studies often ignored the Protectorate or assumed that the treatment of Jews mirrored that in Germany and Austria, today we know that the situation in the Protectorate differed in key aspects, many of which influenced the situation of \"mixed\" families."

Suddenly surrounded by Nazi Germany and its Slovak Ally and the immediate outbreak of the war against Poland in the summer, there was nowhere in the vicinity left to flee. Obtaining emigration visas had already become increasingly hard by mid-1939. Perhaps Martha Saraffian was also occupied with caring for her daughter and parents, especially her father, who was increasingly sick. She and her husband may also have clung to the hope that eventually the situation would become better, despite all indicators pointing in the other direction. Friedrich Kummermann eventually died of cancer on May 1, 1941 in the district hospital of Městec Králové/Königsstädtel, leaving behind his wife Elvira.

At the end of December 1938, Hitler had decided that, under certain conditions, he would spare intermarried Jews from forcible resettlement to so-called Jewish living areas.  These exemptions – foremost for families in which the husband and the children were non-Jewish – were the first steps in what would evolve into the precarious statuses of a merely \"protected\" and of a \"privileged\" mixed marriage.  The latter were granted further exemptions, depending on gender constellations and children. Following this initial decision, most antisemitic regulations contained special clauses for mixed marriages. One such exemption was implemented in the police decree mandating the visual marking of Jews through a patch. From September 1941 onwards, all Jews in the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia were forced to wear this patch on their clothes, visibly identifying them as Jews.  Paragraph 3 of the police degree ordering the mandatory identification contained an exemption clause for Jews in mixed marriages, if they had children raised as non-Jews, and for Jewish women who were married to non-Jews; not, however, for Jewish men married to non-Jewish women without children. Such exemption clauses prompted mixed families to hope that they would be spared from deportations and eventually even regain their rights. However, the protection awarded by these exemption clauses was treacherous and precarious – and could have been revoked at any time."

His decision was announced on September 29, 1941. In breaking with policy in Germany properand Austria, Jewish spouses in such marriages were to be treated just as all other Jews. This decision was reversed by the authorities in Berlin in October of the same year, when it was decided that, for the Protectorate’s German-Jewish marriages the exemptions would still apply, but not, however, for Czech-Jewish marriages.  From this point onwards two different types of mixed marriages existed in the Protectorate. Essentially all Czech-Jewish marriages were robbed of their \"privileges\" and became merely \"protected\". It is not clear how the Saraffian family was categorized in this respect, given their non-German citizenship and their statelessness. It should be noted that the relevant parts of the Nuremberg laws defining Jews and non-Jews did not differentiate based on citizenship but operated with the terms Jewish and \"of German and related blood\". A person without German citizenship could thus still be \"of German and related blood\" and the marriage would still be considered \"mixed\" and protected. In fact, the German census contained information on intermarriages, with Germans and stateless persons in one category, and persons with foreign citizenships in the other. However, most exemptions and so-called \"privileges\" granted for mixed marriages only applied when there were no children raised as Jews. For example, the exemption from wearing the yellow star stated that the children must have been registered as non-Jews. In the Saraffian’s case, Noemi had been registered as Jewish, as her Trautenau citizen registration clearly shows, making her a \"Geltungsjüdin,\" a Mischling who was \"deemed Jewish.\" So even if the Saraffian family was indeed considered a German-Jewish couple (which we do not know) and not a Czech-Jewish mixed marriage, the family would have not been \"privileged\" and Martha Saraffian and her daughter were still required to wear the patch: \"We got these stars, my Jewish daughter and I. And we had to carry all the-- through the end of the war.\" Martha Saraffian also received ration cards marked with \"Jew,\" which were considerably lower than those for non-Jews and even those for Jews in \"privileged\" mixed marriages. Jews usually did not receive any rations of meat, fresh fruits and vegetables, and other essential foods. Even basic staples such as fat or salt were issued in insufficient amounts."

Three days prior to her birth, on May 27, Czech resistance fighters, affiliated with the Czech government in Exile, ambushed and attacked Heydrich in a suburb of Prague with gunfire and explosives. Heydrich was severely wounded and eventually succumbed to his injuries a week later. Initially, the Czech attackers were able to flee and hide successfully.  In revenge for Heydrich’s death the Germans carried out draconian punitive actions against the Czech and Jewish civil populations in the Protectorate. On June 10, German police and SS units massacred the male populations of the villages of Lidice and Ležáky, which had allegedly supported the attackers, and deported the women to concentration camps. The names of these villages became symbols of the German atrocities carried out in Czechia.  In addition, the Germans also executed several thousand Czech political prisoners and enacted martial law for two months. Parallel to the massacres, thousands of Jews from the Protectorate were deported to Ghetto Theresienstadt/Terezín and concentration camps outside the Protectorate. Among those Jews rounded up for deportation was Martha Saraffian’s mother, Elvira Kummermann:"

Many intermarried Jews were ordered to Prague, where they were declared \"full Jews,\" and thus subject to forced labor.  These were primarily the Czech-Jewish couples, whereas the German-Jewish mixed marriages were by large exempt from this action. The Protectorate’s Ministry for Economy and Labor instructed its subordinate offices in March 1943 that Jews \"living in German-Jewish mixed marriages and, according to the Police decree of September 1, 1941 on the identification of Jews, are exempt from mandatory identification […]\" are not to be called for labor duty, whereas \"Jews living in Czech-Jewish mixed marriages are mandated to be identified based on a special provision\" and thus also subject to slave labor.  The fact that Martha was not called up for labor at this time is a good indicator that her marriage was considered German-Jewish rather than Czech-Jewish. By the end of 1943, only 7,484 Jews were left in the Protectorate, according to the statistics in the Jewish Council of Elders’ yearly report. Of these, 88.% had non-Jewish family members.,028 Jews in the Protectorate were living in mixed marriages, 196 more were either married to Mischlinge or were unmarried with children counting as Mischlinge. Another 1,260 Mischlinge were \"deemed Jewish\" (Geltungsjuden), such as Noemi Saraffian, because they were members of the Jewish community. Only 3,470 or 40.% of the entire group were Jewish by religion at the end of 1943, the majority either Christians or unaffiliated. The number of Mischlinge children was only estimated in the report: 13,000 first-degree Mischlinge (with two Jewish grandparents) and 34,000 second-degree Mischlinge (one Jewish grandparent). The report contained no statistics on how many of the about 6,000 mixed marriages were Czech-Jewish and how many were German-Jewish.  For comparison: in Vienna at the same time 6,259 Jews were left, of whom 5,094 or 81% were living in mixed marriages and 1,080 were Mischlinge \"deemed Jewish.\" 76"

The exact time could not be determined, but from the context he was most likely called-up in the summer of 1944. In July 1944 the Protectorate’s labor offices summoned intermarried non-Jews and Mischlinge for forced labor duty. An internal document of the German State Minister for Bohemia and Moravia from late August 1944 stated: \"first degree Mischlinge and Aryans living in Jewish mixed marriages are called up for special labor assignment outside of their places of residence. […] The calling up to the labor assignment is a temporary measure; the right to abode continues.\" 77 This action mirrored similar efforts in the Old Reich of making Mischlinge and non-Jewish spouses available for forced labor. As neither were deemed \"worthy\" of serving in the armed forces – with rare exceptions – they were mostly assigned to Organisation Todt labor deployments.  While the aim was the same throughout the Reich, the actual implementation varied significantly from region to region. In some regions only a fraction was eventually assigned to these deployments. In the Protectorate it was apparently implemented very strictly. Hrand Saraffian was ordered to an unidentified coal town, where he had to clear rubble and other bomb damage caused by Allied aerial bombing. He was part of a labor detachment that consisted only of intermarried men, according to the testimony: \"all these men that has Jewish woman. All these Christian men had Jewish women.\""

This camp was intended for Jews only and many survivor reports, including such in the Fortunoff Archive, stress the very harsh conditions at Klettendorf, likening it to a concentration camp.

His attempt to protest had obviously been in vain and Martha Saraffian was still ordered to Prague for labor duty.

Nevertheless, the experience of parting from her two-year-old daughter was terrible and traumatic for both mother and daughter, as we learn from the testimony. Her elder daughter Noemi had to come with her mother to Prague, where they were eventually separated from each other. According to Noemi Saraffian’s entry in the so-called Ghetto Theresienstadt card file, she was initially brought to a children’s home (Kinderheim) at Ziegengasse 9 (today: Kozí ulice) and later to a worker’s home (Arbeiterheim) in Kastulusgasse 20 (today: Haštalská).  The exact dates are not completely clear, but it seems she arrived at the children’s home on November 9, 1944 and already a day later was transferred to the worker’s home. According to the card file, she left Prague on December 23, 1944. It is not clear when exactly Martha Saraffian had been summoned to Prague in the first place. According to the previously cited report, about half of the women were brought to the camp by the end of September, the second half by the end of November. It seems most likely that Martha arrived in early November, but it could well have been the case that she already came two months earlier in September. The report also states that the Council of Elders maintained a youth home (Jugendheim) and two daycares for children (Kindertagesheime): \"The youth home cares for the accommodation, feeding and hygiene of the children, that constantly live there. The daycares are for little children, whose parents are occupied during the day.\" 87 Most likely Noemi Saraffian was brought to these homes."

In the Protectorate 3,570 were deported to the ghetto and only 2,803 Jews were exempted for various reasons and allowed to stay in Prague.  Hence about 56% of all remaining Jews – most from mixed marriages and also including children counting-as-Jews (Geltungsjuden) – were deported. Martha Saraffian’s decision to wrongly give her daughter’s status as Christian saved Noemi Saraffian from ghettoization, as in the Protectorate Jewish children had to be brought along, according to the order."

Second, almost all Jews had already been concentrated in Prague, a large number in Hagibor. This was a significant difference between the Protectorate and other parts of the Reich. It effectively meant that there was no space for decisions by the various local and regional Nazi authorities – some of whom already saw coming the end of their regime and so, as happened in other German and Austrian regions, simply did not implement the order or were more lenient."

Many of her family members, including her mother, had been in Theresienstadt at one point, before being further deported to concentration and extermination camps. \"Nobody survived from my family. I was the only one.\" One of the family members who was eventually murdered was her father’s sister, Martha’s aunt, Ida Freund, who had been transported in November 1942 from Prague to Theresienstadt. On October 28, 1944 she was deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered.  Approximately 77,000 Jews from the Protectorate were eventually murdered in the Holocaust.  While slave labor in Theresienstadt resembled the work she had been already forced to perform at Hagibor, the living conditions were even worse. Towards the end, Theresienstadt became the destination of death marches from other concentration camps, bringing thousands of ill prisoners to the ghetto, which eventually caused a huge epidemic. In the last months of its existence, and even after it was liberated, many of the ghetto prisoners died of these diseases."

Couldn’t something be done for us too? We do not care where we go, ultimately maybe with the help of UNRRA […] Us, who were really harmed and hurt, we are not being helped. So I want to help myself and all I hope for is that my husband will change his mind and decides to leave illegally and then brings us to him.

I may have to part with the place, where I belong, because that will be the only thing causing change. My husband still hopes for help from outside but I know that you have to help yourself, that you cannot rely on nobody else. "

This lawsuit, the first of its kind, sent shockwaves through many German and European company headquarters, triggered a wave of laws in the United States facilitating Holocaust restitution, and led to the establishment of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims. As a result of international negotiations, in the year 2000 Germany established the Federal Foundation \"Remembrance, Responsibility and Future\" (Stiftung \"Erinnerung, Verantwortung und Zukunft\"), 102 which compensated former German forced laborers and other victims of the Nazi. Other European countries, such as Austria and the Netherlands, followed suit."
